## 18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

## 18.1 Escalation principles

- 18.1.1 In case the Parties cannot agree on a joint solution for handling disagreements or disputes, a deadlock situation shall be deemed to have occurred and each Party shall notify the other Party hereof by the means of a deadlock notice and simultaneously send a copy of the notice to the Steering Committee. Upon the receipt of such a deadlock notice, the receiving Party shall within ten (10) days of receipt, prepare and circulate to the other Party a statement setting out its position on the matter in dispute and reasons for adopting such position, and simultaneously send a copy of its statement to the Steering Committee. Each such statement shall be considered by the next regular meeting held by the Steering Committee or in a forum meeting specifically called upon by either Party for the settlement of the issue.
- 18.1.2 The members of the Steering Committee shall use reasonable endeavours to resolve a deadlock situation in good faith. As part thereof, the Steering Committee may request the Parties to in good faith develop and agree on a plan to resolve or address the breach, to be presented for the Steering Committee without undue delay. If the Steering Committee agrees upon a resolution or disposition of the matter, the Parties shall agree in writing on terms of such resolution or disposition and the Parties shall procure that such resolution or disposition is fully and promptly carried into effect.
- 18.1.3 If the Steering Committee cannot settle the deadlock within thirty (30) days from the deadlock notice served pursuant to Section 18.1.1 above, such deadlock will be referred to the General Counsels of each Party, which shall use reasonable endeavours to resolve the situation in the same way as indicated above. If no Steering Committee has been established between the Parties, the relevant issue shall be referred to the General Counsels of each Party immediately and Section 18.1.2 above shall not apply.
- 18.1.4 If the General Counsels cannot settle the deadlock within thirty (30) days from the deadlock notice pursuant to the section above, despite using reasonable endeavours to do so, such deadlock will be referred to the Strategic Board for decision. Should the matter not have been resolved by the Strategic Board within thirty (30) days counting from when the matter was referred to them, despite using reasonable endeavours to do so, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with Section Section 18.2 below.
- 18.1.5 All notices and communications exchanged in the course of a deadlock resolution proceeding shall be considered Confidential Information of each Party and be subject to the confidentiality undertaking in Section 14 above.
- 18.1.6 Notwithstanding the above, the Parties agree that either Party may disregard the time frames set forth in this Section 18.1 and apply shorter time frames and/or escalate an issue directly to the Strategic Board in the event the escalated issue is of an urgent character and where the applicable time frames set out above are not appropriate.

- 18.2.2 Irrespective of any discussions or disputes between the Parties, each Party shall always continue to fulfil its undertakings under this Agreement unless an arbitral tribunal or court (as the case may be) decides otherwise.
