    "contextual_analysis": "The provided excerpt includes references to standard clauses such as 'Governing Law and Dispute Resolution,' 'Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability,' 'Injunctive Relief and Legal Remedies,' 'Duties and Responsibilities,' and 'Open Source Licenses and Notices.' However, these are not directly integrated into the main contract text but rather referenced. The specific clauses from other agreements (e.g., Open Source Software License Agreement) are used as references for certain terms like dispute resolution and warranties. There is no direct integration of these clauses within the context of a consulting services agreement.",
